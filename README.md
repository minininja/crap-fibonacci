```Crap-Fibonacci```

This is an exercise in writing the most simplistic, tail first implementation of an application to genereate the 45th term in the fibonacci sequeuence.  It is going to be crappy in terms of performance, and you should never actually implement things this way.  But it's interesting to see how well different scripting and compiled (including p-code) languages execute the code and how quickly the result comes back.
